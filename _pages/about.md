I'm a Physics graduate student at the University of Sydney. My plan is to graduate with a Masters by Research before moving overseas (either Europe/UK/USA in 2021) to pursue a PhD. I'm passionate about using tools and ideas from Physics, Mathematics and Computing to tackle challenging interdisciplinary scientific problems.
