I am motivated by playing a small part in working to create a better future for us all.

In my research, I use tools from statistical physics, dynamical systems and AI to understand real experiments, to help solve important fundamental questions in stem cell biology, which have the potential to help develop transformative technologies in regenerative medicine.

Science has become about playing a game and fighting for limited resources, instead of dreaming big, working together on our visions that will change and transform reality. 

I believe scientists all care about entrepreneurship and culture. Fighting to improve our world and organisations is the only way to create a betting world for all. 

Science needs a broader diversity of structures or organisations, small and large. By finding better ways to collaborate we can focus on solving the most pressing issues in society while protecting more independent workers and thinkers.

Beyond being a scientist, I believe that everyone should care about culture and society. To this end, I've started a blog (https://collectivescience.substack.com) and will soon launch a fun, collaborative project in this space with my friends to discuss topics that matter.

I'm happy to chat with likeminded people, a link to my email is below.
