I'm passionate about using tools and ideas from Physics, Mathematics and Computing to tackle challenging interdisciplinary scientific problems.

I recently completed a MPhil in Physics student at the University of Sydney. My research focussed on modelling the fascinating electrical switching dynamics of 'neuromorphic' nanowire networks.

I am now a PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge, where I work with Professor Ben Simons FRS on theoretical biological physics. I'm interested in how non-equilbrium dynamics lead to self-organised pattern formation in morphogenesis and renewal of living cell populations. My interests lie in theory and modelling, but I thrive in close collaboration with experiments.
