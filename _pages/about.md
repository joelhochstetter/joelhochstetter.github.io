I'm passionate about using tools and ideas from Physics, Mathematics and Computing to tackle challenging interdisciplinary scientific problems.

I am a PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics and the Gurdon Institute at the University of Cambridge, where I work with Professor Ben Simons FRS on theoretical biological physics. I'm interested in self-organization and non-equilbrium dynamics in renewal and development of biological tissues. My interests lie in theory and modelling of many-body interacting systems, but I thrive in close collaboration with experiments. Currently I'm working on how squamous tissues (e.g. skin / oesephegus) use mechanical and chemical feedback to maintain homeostasis.

Previously, I completed a Bachelor of Science in Physics at the University of New South Wales, where I completed undergraduate projects spanning from Quantum Physics to DNA nanotechnology. More recently, I did an Honours year and MPhil in Physics student at the University of Sydney. My research focussed on modelling the fascinating electrical switching dynamics of 'neuromorphic' nanowire networks.
