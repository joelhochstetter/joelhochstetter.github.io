I'm passionate about using tools and ideas from Physics, Mathematics and Computing to tackle challenging interdisciplinary scientific problems.

I'm currently a MPhil in Physics student at the University of Sydney. My current research is on modelling the fascinating electrical switching dynamics of 'neuromorphic' nanowire networks.

For my PhD, commencing October 2021 I will work on theoretical biological physics at the University of Cambridge.
