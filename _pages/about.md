I am motivated by playing a small part in working to create a better future for us all.

In my research, I use tools from statistical physics, dynamical systems and AI to help solve fundamental questions in stem cell biology, a field with the potential to develop transformative technologies for human health.

Beyond research, I like to think about big ideas related to society, self and the future. I believe that everyone should care about the culture of their small islands and broader society. To this end, I've started a blog (https://metamorphosia.substack.com) and will soon launch a fun, collaborative project in this space with my friends to discuss topics that matter.

I'm happy to chat with likeminded people, a link to my email is below.
